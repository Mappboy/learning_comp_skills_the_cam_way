# Test week 1
Here is your big test. Do as best you can. 
The questions will increase in difficulty.
Save each command run to a file `(probably use vim to do this, but I'm not your parent)` and when you are done upload the file in the slack channel.
Think like a programmer here, by that I mean Google whatever you want.
Obviously you might want to think about things first, but then Google away.
If you don't know about the `man` and `info` commands. Look them up.
If you use any flags, note in the text what they do.  

... the test begins now, good luck.

1. Begin by downloading the file [fresh_prince.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mappboy/learning_comp_skills_the_cam_way/master/fresh_prince.txt) - can you do this on the command line only?
2. Can you extract the first three lines from fresh_prince.txt?
3. Can you print all the lines in the fresh_prince.txt file to the terminal?
4. How many lines are in the fresh_prince.txt file that aren't empty?
5. Can you find the longest line in the file fresh_prince.txt, what is the text of that line?
6. What is the position (line number) of the line from question 5?
7. How long is the line from question 5?
8. Run the command `echo "echo Hello World" > hw.sh`, how would make this an executable?
9. Can you make the script print out `Hello Michael` with out changing the contents of the file?
10. Excluding whitespace, what is the most common start of each line in the fresh_prince.txt file and how many times does it appear?
11. What does it `Secure Shell` mean and how would you go about doing it on a server?
12. If you have completed the rest of the questions or attempted as many as possible, download the file [test_one_answers.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mappboy/learning_comp_skills_the_cam_way/master/test_one_answers.py)
in this directory and run it using `python test_one_answers.py`, can you make this file executable?
13. Can you figure out which version of python is install on your system ?
