# Programming

## Existing Courses
A general search Google-fu has resulted in the current courses:
- <https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/> 
- <https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-programming>
- <https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming>
- <https://www.freecodecamp.org/>
- <https://www.codecademy.com/>

_This is not a complete list or in anyway an endorsement of any of these courses. Probably best to just Google it yourself, like everything else._

## Why though
Programming is a way of making computers do cool ~shit~ things. 
It _can_ also be a way of saving you time ![xkcd efficient chart](https://xkcd.com/1205/) but it can certainly take a lot of 
time and effort debugging if you don't get it write, or if you fail to estimate the time it takes to do something.
Something which programmers are notoriously bad at.

## Intro
Besides the syntax which we will deal with next week, the most important thing is to start learning to think like a programmer.
This week we will be looking at Logic, Control Structures, Data Types and Structures, Variables and Simple Algorithms. 

### What to figure out
1. The basics of `if`,`then`, `else`, `else if`, `and`, `or`, `nand`, `xor` and how to implement a simple `if` conditional in bash 
(see <https://www.tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_07_01.html> & <https://www.tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_07_02.html>)
2. What is a `switch` or `case` statement ?
3. Can you explain a `for` and `while` loop ?
4. What is a `variable` and a `constant` in programming, how are they used, what is the standard naming practice in python for variables ?
5. What are the basic data types in the python programming language, what about C?
6. What is the size in bytes of a standard integer (int) in the C programming language, what about in python, why is there a difference ?
7. What are the standard data structures in the python programming language?
8. What is an algorithm?
9. What are three different sorting algorithms, which one is the fastest?

### Practical section
Try to provide examples of all the above in the programming/scripting language of your choice:
- Bash
- Javascript
- Python
- C
