# Week Two Tutorial

Depending upon language choice
- Look at the package manager for that language
- npm/npx/nvm for node
- pip for python

If python lets install requests and have a look at some queries with that.
If python lets install ipython and maybe jupyter notebooks, maybe pycharm

Lets go through 

1. The basics of `if`,`then`, `else`, `else if`, `and`, `or`, `nand`, `xor` and how to implement a simple `if` conditional in bash 
if (-n exists);do () done; fi

2. What is a `switch` or `case` statement ?
Talk through the python equivalent using dict

3. Can you explain a `for` and `while` loop ?
Explain why for is preffered and the dangers of infinite loops

4. What is a `variable` and a `constant` in programming, how are they used, what is the standard naming practice in python for variables ?

snake case motherfucker 

5. What are the basic data types in the python programming language, what about C?
strings, ints, floats, bools 

6. What is the size in bytes of a standard integer (int) in the C programming language, what about in python, why is there a difference ?

4 byte vs 28 byte

7. What are the standard data structures in the python programming language?
data: int, float, str, bool
structs: list, dict, set

8. What is an algorithm?


9. What are three different sorting algorithms, which one is the fastest?

Prep next week


Let's maybe install a saner easier to use sh
brew install fish
curl -L https://get.oh-my.fish | fish
omf install spacefish

echo /usr/local/bin/fish | sudo tee -a /etc/shells
chsh -s /usr/local/bin/fish
https://rootnroll.com/d/fish-shell/

Set up fish advise 
Next week lets cover lists dicts and sets, 
functions and algorithms like sorting.
