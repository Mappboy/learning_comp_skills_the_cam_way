## Why though
So really the purpose of this week is to go from clicky-clicky to typey-typey.
Typey-typey is a much more efficient way in the end. Although it won't seem that way to begin with.

## Intro
Pretty much you could spend years learning this stuff some people do.
Do some general perusing of links. 

### What to figure out
0) How do you computers works (RAM/CPU/GPU/Storage)?
1) What's is an OS and what are the differences between them `/r/n vs /n`?
2) *nix systems how do they work?
3) Why is Linux the best one?
4) Install homebrew and iterm2 on your Mac
5) Navigating the command line (cd/pwd/mkdir/rm/touch etc) user+file commands (cat/less/chown/chmod/users/groups/stdin/stdout/redirection)
6) The cool commands (grep/ps/awk/sed/curl)
7) Using Vim
8) Bash scripts and cron

# Practical Section
*Important side notes: Firstly never copy and paste anything online unless you are 1000%  positive of it's effects. I am not your daddy, if you destroy your computer you fix it.*

*The most deadly command is `rm -rf /`
(https://askubuntu.com/questions/670648/what-does-rm-rf-do)[avada kedavra for computers] never ever do this. Ever ever. Seriously*

- Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- Install [iterm2](https://iterm2.com/)
- Open up iterm2 and start playing around with https://www.tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/html/index.html everything up to about section 8 is good.
- Have a look at https://www.tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/ play around and write a few simple scripts everything there is good but no need to go into advance stuff

# For next week
- Install python3.7 https://binx.io/blog/2019/04/12/installing-pyenv-on-macos/
