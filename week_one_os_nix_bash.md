## Why though
So really the purpose of this week is to go from clicky-clicky to typey-typey.
Typey-typey is a much more efficient way in the end. Although it won't seem that way to begin with.

## Intro
Pretty much you could spend years learning this stuff some people do.
Do some general perusing of links. 

### What to figure out
0) How do you computers works (RAM/CPU/GPU/Storage)?
1) What's is an OS and what are the differences between them? 
2) *nix systems how do they work?
3) Why is Linux the best one?
4) Install homebrew and iterm2 on your Mac
5) Navigating the command line (cd/pwd/mkdir/rm/touch/whoami/users etc)
6) The cool commands (grep/ps/awk/sed)
7) Using Vim

# Practical Section
*Important side notes: Firstly never copy and paste anything online unless you are 1000%  positive of it's effects. I am not your daddy, if you destroy your computer you fix it.*

*The most deadly command is `rm -rf /`
(https://askubuntu.com/questions/670648/what-does-rm-rf-do)[avada kedavra for computers] never ever do this. Ever ever. Seriously*

- Install (https://brew.sh/)[homebrew]
