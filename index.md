# How this will work
You (Michael) do as much or as little research into each topic.

However there will be a test, I will decide what will be on the test when I decide what is on the test.
Basically though just LEARN ! 

But seriously you could spend weeks/years on anyone of these topics. In fact you will. Right now though just learn enough so you have a general understanding. Make sure you f*ck around with the stuff though and try not to remove your home directory or paste anything from the internet.

# Websites
*These are just general sites that might interest you as you become more involved with tech stuff*
- https://stackoverflow.com/ (Programmers helping other programmers)
- https://medium.com/ (It has over stuff but the tech articles are usually quite good)
- https://dev.to/ (Like medium but more developer stuff)

# Sidenote
